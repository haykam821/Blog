title: Developer Environment Guide
---

This is my personal guide to getting a working developer environment from scratch on macOS.

## Getting Started

First off, open System Preferences and choose the dark appearance. This is **very** important!!

After we have prevented eye strain, we need the Xcode Command Line Tools. Although they come preinstalled with Xcode, you can also get them seperately to avoid a large download.

After this, we can install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a macOS package manager. Run this script:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

With Homebrew, we can now install packages without doing all the dirty work.

## Terminal

Since we'll be spending time in the terminal a lot, we should probably get a good one, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/):

```bash
brew cask install iterm2
```

Personally, I really enjoy the Ubuntu fonts. As such, I use the monospaced variant for my terminal. First we must install the Ubuntu fonts (Ubuntu, Ubuntu Condensed, and Ubuntu Mono) from Homebrew Cask:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-ubuntu
```

Then, we set the font by going to iTerm's preferences, and under the `Profile` tab we can change the font by navigating to the `Text` section and clicking the `Change Font` button. If you do not like `15px Ubuntu Mono`, you can use the default of `12px Monaco`, which is also good.

## Shell

We'll also want to install an alternative shell, specifically `zsh`:

```bash
brew install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Afterwards, we will install [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), a configuration manager for it:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Quick Look

These are not required to be installed as they just enhance the experience. These plugins extend Quick Look, one of my personal favorite features on macOS.

Install all the extensions with this one-liner:

```bash
brew cask install qlcolorcode qlstephen qlmarkdown quicklook-json qlprettypatch quicklook-csv betterzipql webpquicklook suspicious-package
```

## Internet

I only need one browser to access the internet, Chrome. Specifically, Ungoogled Chromium, which is a version that patches out all the Google integrations.

```bash
brew cask install eloston-chromium
```

I also use other browsers in order to ensure my web content works on different platforms. Thus, we will install Firefox as well:

```bash
brew cask install firefox
```

Safari is not included for obvious reasons (it is preinstalled).

## Password Management

1Password is my password manager, so I'll install it as well:

```bash
brew cask install 1password
```

I sync 1Password's vaults through iCloud. This can be configured by opening 1Password, opening the Preferences menu, clicking the Sync tab, and change "Sync **Primary** vault with" to iCloud.

Once the passwords are synced, we can go ahead and sign into Reddit and other websites.

## Chatting

I use Discord and Slack to communicate. Luckily, Homebrew lets us install these too:

```bash
brew cask install discord slack
```

## Node.js

Of course, I need to ensure my projects work on the latest, stable, and LTS releases of Node.js, so I use a fast version switcher called [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n) instead. Thanks to Homebrew, we just need to run a simple command:

```bash
brew install n
```

This will start the installation of `n`. Once it is finished, install the versions we need:

```bash
n latest
n stable
n lts
```

Now we can install our ESLint utilities, like [my config](https://github.com/haykam821/ESLint-Config-Haykam) and [ESLint itself](https://eslint.org/):

```bash
npm install -g eslint eslint-config-haykam
```

We can also install [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), a CLI tool allowing for automatic restart of scripts when a file changes:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

Here is a one-liner to install all the packages listed above from NPM:

```bash
npm install -g eslint eslint-config-haykam nodemon
```

## Visual Studio Code

Go ahead and install Visual Studio Code from Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

My theme is [Atom One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark) and I use [file-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=file-icons.file-icons) to help me tell apart my files without having to look at the extension.

Here are my main user settings:

```json
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Atom One Dark",
    "workbench.iconTheme": "file-icons",
}
```

The rest of my settings are synced using [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync). To install that extension, run:

```bash
code --install-extension Shan.code-settings-sync
```

Then, initiate the sync by pressing <kbd>Option+Shift+D</kbd>.

## Git

We should already have Git installed from Xcode Command Line Tools.

I prefer [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as an interface for Git, and it can be installed directly from Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install github
```

Start up GitHub Desktop and configure:

- Log into GitHub.
- Set the appearance to dark.
- Change the external editor to Visual Studio Code, which we installed earlier.

I usually clone the frequently used repos of mine to my disk as well.

## Databases

Now we can install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install mariadb
brew services start mariadb
```

This will install MariaDB, then allow Homebrew to auto-start it.

I use [Sequel Pro](https://sequelpro.com/), which is free despite its name, to interactively view and edit databases:

```bash
brew cask install sequel-pro
```
